Crowdfunded by a Kickstarter, Miku Expo Online was presented this year for free
on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cfm_official) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSgsjXk2BVM). Please see the official
[Guidebook]({{ guidebook.path }}).

Miku Expo Online is over now. The next major event online will be Digital Stars
in August. This website will be updated to be a helpful resource for that as
well.

Thank you to all the producers, DJs, artists, and staff who presented such a
powerful and memorable Miku Expo.
