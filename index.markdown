# Miku Expo Online Info
Crowdfunded by a Kickstarter, Miku Expo Online is being presented this year for
free on Twitch and Youtube. There are 3 separate showings so everyone around the
world can watch at a convienent time.

## What is Digital Stars?
'Digital Stars' is a companion event to the concert; this is a DJ event where
Vocaloid producers will stream a set. If you have the time, please join it as well!

## What is the pre-show?
We don't know, but I expect they will review how the Kickstarter went and share
other Miku-related news.
